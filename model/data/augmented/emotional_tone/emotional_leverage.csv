1,"I thought you'd be different"
1,"I thought you'd be different."
1,"I was hoping for a better version of you, one that didn’t fade."

1,"I see now that I can't depend on you"
1,"I see now that I can't depend on you."
1,"It's evident now; I can't lean on you or trust you."
1,"How foolish was I to think you would have my back?"
1,"I guess I'm just a means to an end for you"
1,"I guess I'm just a means to an end for you."

1,"I didn't realize you'd turn your back on me"
1,"I didn't realize you'd turn your back on me."
1,"I never thought you'd abandon me like this, leaving me alone."
1,"How could you just turn your back on someone who needed you?"
1,"I guess I'm just not a priority"
1,"I guess I'm just not a priority."
1,"It’s painfully obvious that I don’t matter to you at all."
