2,"Can you remind me what brought it back up?"
2,"It’s upsetting that you’re putting words in my mouth; I feel like you’re not recognizing my perspective."
2,"Could you have reminded me what brought it back up?"
2,"You believed you were acting within the guidelines."
2,"Will you remind me what will bring it back up?"
2,"You weren't informed about that detail."
2,"If I did say that, I’m embarrassed because it truly wasn't my intention."
2,"I can’t recall getting that email."
2,"If I had said that, I was embarrassed because it truly wasn't my intention."
2,"I must have misunderstood the requirements."

2,"You didn't realize that was mandatory."
2,"Please tell me how I will overlook something so important!"
2,"You must have been distracted when that was explained."
2,"It’s upsetting that you’re putting words in my mouth; I feel like you’re not recognizing my perspective."
2,"Please jog my memory; I'm totally blanking!"
2,"It was upsetting that you were putting words in my mouth; I felt like you weren’t recognizing my perspective."
2,"I don't recall being notified about that"
2,"It will be upsetting that you will put words in my mouth; I will feel like you’re not recognizing my perspective."
2,"You overlooked that point; you wish you could rewind and correct this oversight."
2,"You believed you were acting within the guidelines."
2,"You were unaware that this was necessary."
2,"You were unaware that this was necessary."
2,"You didn't realize that was inappropriate."
2,"You had been unaware that this was necessary."
2,"They were unaware that was the situation."
2,"You will be unaware that this will be necessary."
2,"You thought we were following a different plan."

2,"You hadn’t realized that was inappropriate."
2,"You have no recollection of agreeing to that plan."
2,"You won’t realize that will be inappropriate."
2,"You weren't provided with sufficient information to understand that."
2,"They were unaware that was the situation."
2,"They didn’t quite see that as a problem."
2,"They had been unaware that was the situation."
2,"It’s hard for them to accept that you hid this from them; they feel like they’re in the dark."
2,"They will be unaware that will be the situation."
2,"I must not have grasped what was necessary."
2,"You thought we were following a different plan."
2,"I must have missed that announcement"
2,"You had thought we were following a different plan."
2,"You don't remember doing that."

2,"You weren't aware that was the guideline."
2,"You thought you had more time to deal with it."
2,"I wasn't aware that was the guideline"
2,"You had thought you had more time to deal with it."
2,"It wasn’t your intention to overlook that guideline."
2,"You will think you will have more time to deal with it."
2,"I never received the information regarding that."
2,"You have no recollection of agreeing to that plan."
2,"You likely missed that section in the briefing."
2,"You had no recollection of agreeing to that plan."
2,"That must have been explained when I wasn't there"
2,"You will have no recollection of agreeing to that plan."
2,"You didn’t receive information on that aspect."
2,"You weren't provided with sufficient information to understand that."
2,"I did not receive information about that aspect."
2,"You had not been provided with sufficient information to understand that."
2,"Why didn’t I step in sooner to explain what was allowed?"
2,"You will not be provided with sufficient information to understand that."
2,"I can't believe I missed that when it seems so essential to understand."
2,"They didn’t quite see that as a problem."
2,"It’s baffling that you didn’t obtain clearer directions on what was required of you!"
2,"They had not quite seen that as a problem."
2,"You didn't know that was the case."
2,"They won’t quite see that as a problem."
2,"I had no idea that was the rule"
2,"It’s hard for them to accept that you hid this from them; they feel like they’re in the dark."
2,"You misread what was required."
2,"You misread what was required."
2,"The thought of me agreeing to that doesn’t ring a bell."
2,"You misread what is required."
2,"I thought that was optional."
2,"You will misread what is required."
2,"You weren’t aware that was considered inappropriate."
2,"I can't seem to recall being informed about that."
2,"The thought of me agreeing to that didn’t ring a bell."
2,"You had no idea that was a concern."
2,"The thought of me agreeing to that doesn’t ring a bell."
2,"It's so frustrating to discover that I’ve been doing things incorrectly because I didn’t know!"
2,"The thought of me agreeing to that won’t ring a bell."
2,"How could they follow protocols they haven’t even been notified about?"
2,"It leaves you feeling uneasy that you didn’t realize that was your responsibility."
2,"I thought that was optional."
2,"I don’t remember seeing that notice."
2,"I think that is optional."
2,"I simply didn’t connect the dots on that situation."
2,"I will think that is optional."
2,"You likely don’t recall that memo at all."
2,"They feel so lost and let down knowing they missed something that should have been communicated!"
2,"You weren’t aware that was considered inappropriate."
2,"You may not have pieced everything together at that moment; it’s frustrating to feel this way during the process."
2,"You aren’t aware that it is considered inappropriate."
2,"It’s incredibly disheartening to think you didn't put it all together when it mattered."
2,"You won’t be aware that it is considered inappropriate."
2,"It’s concerning to consider that you might have overlooked something important in your talks!"
2,"They didn't realize that was the final decision; it crushes them to feel blindsided by the outcome."
2,"I can't seem to recall being informed about that."
2,"You didn't know that was against the policy."
2,"I cannot seem to recall being informed about that."
2,"Can I let you know how I was supposed to know?"
2,"I will not seem to recall being informed about that."
2,"They weren't aware that was the case."
2,"I thought that instruction was meant for someone else"
2,"You had no idea that was a concern."
2,"You weren’t informed of any time constraints."
2,"You have no idea that it is a concern."
2,"I continue to believe you expressed things that didn't come up at all."
2,"You will have no idea that it is a concern."
2,"Can you refresh my memory on what sparked that discussion again?"
2,"I didn't catch that in the instructions; it’s a bitter pill to swallow knowing I let it slip by."
2,"It's so frustrating to discover that I’ve been doing things incorrectly because I didn’t know!"
2,"You weren't aware that was the standard; you feel lost and ashamed for not being in the loop."
2,"You weren't aware that was the standard; you felt lost and ashamed for not being in the loop."
2,"I can’t remember consenting to that at all."
2,"You are not aware that is the standard; you feel lost and ashamed for not being in the loop."
2,"I must have misunderstood the requirements"
2,"You will not be aware that that is the standard; you will feel lost and ashamed for not being in the loop."
2,"It's really disheartening to learn I wasn’t informed that it was due today."
2,"I can’t remember consenting to that at all."
2,"You thought that was just a suggestion."
2,"I couldn't remember consenting to that at all."
2,"I feel so left out of the loop, and it’s frustrating to find out this way!"
2,"I won’t remember consenting to that at all."
2,"You didn't put two and two together at the time; it’s disheartening to feel so lost in the process."
2,"I must have misunderstood the requirements."
2,"Why couldn’t I communicate more effectively that this was something I needed from you?"
2,"I must be misunderstanding the requirements."
2,"Why do I feel so lost when it seems like everyone else is informed?"
2,"I will surely misunderstand the requirements."
2,"It’s so distressing to think that you might have missed an important update!"
2,"It's really disheartening to learn I wasn’t informed that it was due today."
2,"You weren’t aware that was included in the agreement."
2,"It's really disheartening to learn I am not informed that it is due today."
2,"It’s disheartening to admit that I might have missed something significant!"
2,"It's going to be really disheartening to learn I won’t be informed that it is due today."
2,"I was sure I had already mentioned that to you."
2,"You thought that was just a suggestion."
2,"You feel so ashamed for not understanding the requirements correctly!"
2,"You thought that had been just a suggestion."
2,"You don't remember that at all."
2,"You will think that will be just a suggestion."
2,"I really don’t recall making that statement at all."
2,"I feel so left out of the loop, and it’s frustrating to find out this way!"
2,"You believed this situation was resolved a while back."
2,"I felt so left out of the loop, and it was frustrating to find out that way!"
2,"Could you explain where our understandings diverged?"
2,"I will feel so left out of the loop, and it will be frustrating to find out this way!"
2,"You thought someone else had already handled it."
2,"You didn't put two and two together at the time; it’s disheartening to feel so lost in the process."
2,"How is it that I’ve never come across that timetable before?"
2,"You hadn't put two and two together at the time; it was disheartening to feel so lost in the process."
2,"Please explain how you could have overlooked something so significant!"
2,"You won’t put two and two together at the time; it will be disheartening to feel so lost in the process."
2,"They were completely unaware of that guideline."
2,"Why couldn’t I communicate more effectively that this was something I needed from you?"
2,"It’s surprising that you didn’t realize that was the case."
2,"Why can’t I communicate more effectively that this is something I need from you?"
2,"You don't remember agreeing to that plan."
2,"Why won’t I be able to communicate more effectively that this is something I will need from you?"
2,"It pains me to think I could forget something so important; I wish I could recall it."
2,"Why do I feel so lost when it seems like everyone else is informed?"
2,"Finding out I missed a requirement hits me hard!"
2,"Finding out I missed a requirement hit me hard!"
2,"I don't remember agreeing to that."
2,"Finding out I missed a requirement hits me hard!"
2,"The realization that you’ve been missing a requirement feels like a heavy blow!"
2,"Finding out I will miss a requirement will hit me hard!"
2,"That must have been explained when you weren’t present."
2,"I didn't remember agreeing to that."
2,"You keep insisting I said words that I didn't even mention."
2,"I don't remember agreeing to that."
2,"I thought that was optional"
2,"I won't remember agreeing to that."
2,"It’s disheartening to think that you could have missed such a significant detail!"
2,"The realization that I’ve been missing a requirement felt like a heavy blow!"
2,"They seemed to overlook the importance of that detail."
2,"The realization that you’ve been missing a requirement feels like a heavy blow!"
2,"I wasn't told that was the procedure; I feel a hollow ache in knowing I failed to meet expectations."
2,"The realization that you will be missing a requirement will feel like a heavy blow!"
2,"You don’t recall agreeing to that at any point."
2,"That must have been explained when you weren’t present."
2,"You don't recall being told about that change."
2,"That must be explained when you aren’t present."
2,"Why wasn’t there a clearer way for you to communicate your expectations from the start?"
2,"That will have to be explained when you aren’t present."
2,"They were completely in the dark about that guideline."
2,"You kept insisting I said words that I didn't even mention."
2,"Why is it so tough for you to stay on top of timelines when they seem so important?"
2,"You keep insisting I said words that I didn't even mention."
2,"I don't recall that ever being mentioned."
2,"You will keep insisting I said words that I didn't even mention."
2,"You didn’t realize how that was related."
2,"I thought that was optional."
2,"I completely forgot about that detail."
2,"I think that is optional."
2,"I thought someone else had it handled; it makes me feel a bit foolish for not checking."
2,"I will think that will be optional."
2,"They didn't know that was against the policy."
2,"It was disheartening to think that you could have missed such a significant detail!"
2,"How could they possibly follow protocols they haven't even been informed about?"
2,"It’s disheartening to think that you could have missed such a significant detail!"
2,"How am I supposed to handle this if I’m left out of the loop regarding critical information?"
2,"It will be disheartening to think that you could miss such a significant detail!"
2,"You didn't realize that was the plan."
2,"They seemed to have overlooked the importance of that detail."
2,"Can you clarify how I overlooked that information?"
2,"They seem to overlook the importance of that detail."
2,"I thought I had more time to handle it"
2,"They will seem to overlook the importance of that detail."
2,"That must have been discussed while you were absent; it really hurts to feel left out of significant information."
2,"I wasn't told that was the procedure; I felt a hollow ache in knowing I failed to meet expectations."
