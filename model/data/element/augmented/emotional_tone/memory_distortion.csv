104,1,You're just being too sensitive; it was a harmless comment
104,1,You're seriously overreacting; my comment was completely harmless.
104,1,"I can't believe how sensitive you are; it was nothing, really."
104,1,You're being too touchy; it was just a light-hearted comment.
105,1,You're remembering it wrong
105,1,You must be remembering things wrong; that's not how it went.
105,1,I think you're misrecalling the events; let’s try to clarify.

108,1,You're absolutely overthinking this; there's really nothing to be concerned about.
108,1,It's not worth it; try to ease your mind because you’re worrying for no reason.
108,1,You’re creating problems where there aren’t any; just let it go.
109,1,You're always so difficult
109,1,You're always such a handful; can't you see that?
109,1,Why are you always making things so complicated?
109,1,You're being difficult again; why can't you just take things easy?
