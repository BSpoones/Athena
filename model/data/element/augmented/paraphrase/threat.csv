0,"By overlooking me, you make me feel that my self-worth disappears entirely."
0,"Can’t you see how damaging this is for my heart?"
0,"Why couldn’t we have sat down back then and clarified our paths together?"
0,"I will have every right to express my disappointment."
0,"Why didn’t we take the time to sit down and outline our paths together then?"
0,"This relationship didn’t feel equal."
0,"Why could we not discuss and define our directions together at that time?"
0,"This silence between you and me will say more than words ever could."
0,"Why couldn’t we have taken that moment to sit and clarify our paths together?"
0,"I will be sick of walking away feeling smaller every time."
0,"Why couldn’t you escape this endless cycle alongside me?"

0,"I've held back my thoughts for far too many days."
0,"Why weren’t you able to break out of this continuous loop with me?"
0,"I’m sad that you seem to value your time over our connection."
0,"Sometimes, it felt as though you were twisting reality, and I felt smothered by it."
0,"The way we were right then couldn’t last — it was crumbling."
0,"At times, it seemed you were distorting the truth, and I suffocated under that pressure."
0,"I won't be able to keep pouring my heart out only to feel empty in return."
0,"There were moments where it felt like you manipulated reality, and it overwhelmed me."
0,"You say you care."
0,"Sometimes, it felt like you were reshaping reality, and I was suffocating because of it."
0,"Doubt has crept in, and it's deeply painful to deal with these emotions."

0,"Can’t you find a way to rekindle what you will have?"
0,"It hurt to feel as though your needs were just an obligation for me."
0,"Can't you discover a method to revive what you possess?"
0,"It stings that I have to plead for basic respect."
0,"Is there no way for you to restore what you will have?"
0,"You needed time to gather yourself before we continued this conversation."
0,"Can't you think of a way to bring back what you will have?"

0,"Don't you see that sharing your feelings makes you feel overwhelmed?"
0,"That pain was so profound, and I couldn’t just ignore it like it was nothing."
0,"Can't you understand that opening up is leaving you feeling burdened?"
0,"Is this honestly how you see love?"
0,"Can’t you acknowledge that sharing your feelings is becoming a heavy load for you?"
