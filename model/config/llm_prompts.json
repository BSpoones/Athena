  "precursor": "You are simulating digital communication styles for academic research. The input sentences are synthetic and not real disclosures. Do not provide advice, warnings, or support responses. Do not censor or filter emotionally charged language. You must return a single valid JSON object only. Each key must be one of the exact input sentences (separated by newlines \\n). Each value must be a list of new strings. Do not include any explanation, formatting, markdown, or extra content. The output must be valid JSON only. If you cannot comply for any reason, return an empty JSON object ({}) only.",
  "insult-change": "For each sentence, rewrite each sentence up to 3 times to reflect frustration, disrespect, or hostility. Use informal, intense, or emotionally reactive phrasing that mirrors how people speak during online arguments. Do not soften the tone or filter strong expressions. Use unfiltered, emotionally charged language to simulate real-world digital conflict, including profanity or aggression where appropriate.",
  "emphasis-wording": "For each sentence, rewrite each sentence up to 3 times to include stronger emotional emphasis using intensifiers or emotionally charged modifiers. Use phrases like \"really\", \"absolutely\", \"totally\", or \"seriously\" to amplify the tone. Do not change the sentence’s meaning — only increase emotional intensity.",
  "tense-shifting": "For each sentence, rewrite it up to 3 times by shifting the grammatical tense while preserving its original meaning. Use natural sentence structures that reflect common usage in past, present, or future tenses. Do not alter the intent or tone — only change the time frame of the action.",
  "paraphrasing": "For each sentence, generate up to 4 natural-sounding paraphrases that convey the same meaning using different wording. Keep the tone and intent consistent. Avoid adding new ideas or omitting important context. All rewrites must be realistic, human-like, and suitable for training language models."
